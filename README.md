>>>>>>> Development

### Installation
Run `npm install`.

Install [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/), enter the web interface and set a new password.
It has been tested only with the docker version of neo4j downloaded from the [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) app.

> **Important:** Make sure that the variables in the `.env` file are properly set,
because the docker version of neo4j doesn't use the default ports.

Same for [redis](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart). Or just download the docker image from Kitematic.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the settings as needed.

### Start server
Run `npm run build` to transpile the code to javascript, run this before `start`.

Run `npm run debug` to start server in development mode with live reload.

Run `npm test` to run the tests.

## Project Structure
The `test` folder remain top level as expected.

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

> **Note!** Make sure you have already built the app using `npm run build` before `npm start`.

## Building the project
If you're concerned about compile time, the main watch task takes ~2s to refresh.

### Configuring TypeScript compilation
TypeScript uses the file `tsconfig.json` to adjust project compile options.
Let's dissect this project's `tsconfig.json`, starting with the `compilerOptions` which details how your project is compiled.

```json
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es6",
        "noImplicitAny": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "outDir": "dist",
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
            "*": [
                "node_modules/*",
                "src/types/*"
            ]
        }
    },
```

| `compilerOptions` | Description |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"module": "commonjs"`             | The **output** module type (in your `.js` files). Node uses commonjs, so that is what we use           |
| `"target": "es6"`                  | The output language level. Node supports ES6, so we can target that here                               |
| `"noImplicitAny": true`            | Enables a stricter setting which throws errors when something has a default `any` value                |
| `"moduleResolution": "node"`       | TypeScript attempts to mimic Node's module resolution strategy. Read more [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#node)                                                                    |
| `"sourceMap": true`                | We want source maps to be output along side our JavaScript. See the [debugging](#debugging) section          |
| `"outDir": "dist"`                 | Location to output `.js` files after compilation                                                       |
| `"baseUrl": "."`                   | Part of configuring module resolution. See [path mapping section](#installing-dts-files-from-definitelytyped) |
| `paths: {...}`                     | Part of configuring module resolution. See [path mapping section](#installing-dts-files-from-definitelytyped) |



The rest of the file define the TypeScript project context.
This project is fairly simple and all of our .ts files are under the `src` folder.


### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.

If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.

Below is a list of all the scripts available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                      |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `tslint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                               |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `build-sass`              | Compiles all `.scss` files to `.css` files                                                        |
| `watch-sass`              | Same as `build-sass` but continuously watches `.scss` files and re-compiles when needed             |
| `tslint`                  | Runs TSLint on project files                                                                      |
